# Learn to Protect your Digital Privacy

## Organised by Fellow Software Workers

An informal gathering to bring together fellow workers to share information
about how to protect our privacy online.

All levels of interest and skill are welcome.

Surveillance capitalists have seized the levers of power and created the most
pervasive transnational network of surveillance in history. They deny us our
basic human right to privacy!

It is our moral imperative to organise!

Take your digital privacy back with free and open source software. Learn simple
techniques to protect your privacy in your daily life. Connect with fellow software
workers and help diffuse this information to all members of society.
