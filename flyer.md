# Organising? Get Organised!

## IWW WISE-RA Tech Tips

Here are some quick tech tips and tricks to help you improve your organising
capacity and simultaneously protect yourself from [state and corporate
surveillance](https://riseup.net/en/security).

### Email And Dealing With Mailing Lists

Mailing lists can be frustrating especially if you are signed up to many
different lists. We would recommend setting up a completely separate email
address for your organising activities to keep your union activities separate
from your day to day email usage.

This also gives you a degree of separation from your personal identity, which
isn't the same as anonymity but can be useful in an organising context.

You can also decide whether you want your union email address to be on your
various devices. A lot of people don't want all their union emails to come to
their phone constantly and prefer to catch up on emails when they feel
comfortable and able.

Some alternative email services that you might consider:

* [Posteo](https://posteo.de/en)  (Paid service)
* [Proton Mail](https://protonmail.com/) (Paid service with free tier)
* [RiseUp](https://riseup.net/en)  (Donations)
* [Espiv](https://espiv.net/en/) (Donations)
* [Autistici](https://www.autistici.org/)  (Donations)
* [Mailbox](https://mailbox.org/en/)  (Paid service)
* [Aktivix](https://aktivix.org/)  (Donations)

You can also request a iww.org.uk email. We recommend that you use
[Thunderbird](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/) to access your IWW
email as the webmail we currently have sucks.

Thunderbird should automatically guess all your details apart from your
username which has to be formatted in a specific way. If your email address is
**example@iww.org.uk** then your username will be **example.iww.org.uk**.
Notice the "." rather than an "@".

Further information can be found [here](https://docs.webarch.net/wiki/Email).

### Email For The Win

Once you have your email account setup in Thunderbird you can start using mails
filters to automatically sort your incoming emails into different folders based
on a specific criteria.

The
[documentation](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/organize-your-messages-using-filters)
for this process is kind of crappy but you can get started by going to `Tools >
Message > Filters` in the menu and create a new filter.

### Moving Beyond Email

However, email a somewhat archaic system and was never designed with security
in mind. If you require secure communications [and believe us you
do](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_%28surveillance_program%29), you should
use end to end encryption. In other words, strong mathematics that ensure
that only the intended recipients can read your messages and no one is able
to snoop on them in the middle.

The easiest way of setting up a secure means of talking is by using Signal
which is available on Android, iOS and as a Chrome App. If you and your friends
both install the app and share phone numbers then you can exchange messages and
calls with all the modern features you'd expect such as video, pictures group
chats and disappearing messages but with open source encryption technology
protecting you.

The design of the Signal protocol is so highly regarded that WhatsApp recently
incorporated it into their app, bringing end to end encryption to over 1.2
billion people around the globe.

### WobChat

The WISE-RA tech department have also just launched a new chat platform called
WobChat based upon the open source  [RocketChat](https://rocket.chat/)
software.

You can use it to communicate and connect with members from around the UK and
Ireland. There are many different "channels" or chat rooms for different
topics. If you need to start your own channel for a project, you can just do it
without waiting for anyone. There is file sharing, video conferencing and many
other slick features.

To login, simply visit  [chat.iww.org.uk](https://chat.iww.org.uk/) and login
with your members area details.

There are also apps available for a variety of platforms including Android and
iOS. You can  [download them here](https://rocket.chat/download).
